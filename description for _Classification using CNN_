We are using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train the machine learning model for classifying the eye images as 
"Normal" or "Cataract".

The dataset generated was split into training and testing portions in the ratio of 4:1 ratio. 
As a result, we had training data for -> 1556 images
                    testing data for  -> 389 images
                    
The CNN was designed to run for 30 epocs ie the entire training dataset would be iterated 30 times for readjusting the weights of the CNN.
The model has an accuracy score of: 0.9640102829295749 or 96.401% 

At the end of the model prediction, the trained model is saved as "CNNCataract.h5" file. The ".h5" file stores the various weight values
for any future prediction so that we need not train the model everytime we need to make a prediction.
