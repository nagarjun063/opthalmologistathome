We manually downloaded 17 images from google of eyes with cataract. Then we ran the code, as shown in the jupyter notebook, to 
generate 1000 cataract eye images. We added basic augmentations to the original images like:
>rotate
>flip_left_right
>random zoom
>flip_top_bottom

We used the "Augmentor" library to implement these functions. 
As a result, we were able to generate a part of the dataset which containg 1000 images for eyes having cataract.

Similarly, we manually downloaded 17 images of normal eyes and performed the same feature augmentations to generate 
1000 normal eye images.
